          The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of
          the red junglefowl, with attributes of wild species such as grey and
          ceylon junglefowl<sup><a href="xxxxxxxx">[1]</a></sup> that are
          originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an
          adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
          that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a
          hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
          bird.<sup>[when?]</sup> However, thanks to its usage on restaurant
          menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in
          general, especially in American English. In older sources, chicken as
          a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.

        <h3>Behaviour</h3>
        <h4>Social Behaviour</h4>
        <p>
          When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
          does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and
          dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens
          to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
          lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances,
          such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).
          Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings,
          but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
